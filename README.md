Hi! I’m Marija, a final-year Software Engineering student at the University of Belgrade (ETF), currently one exam away from graduation and excited to begin my professional journey as a software engineer.

I enjoy building reliable and well-structured software and have hands-on experience ranging from low-level systems work to full stack development. I’m especially motivated to keep improving my engineering fundamentals and to grow through real-world challenges.
